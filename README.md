This is a totally reworked UI for the SW102, compatible with open source firmware for the TSDZ2 ebike motor. 

Currently it is a work in progress, it's usable, but many important parts (notably the configuration menus) are still missing. 
So far, the eeprom configuration format has not been modified, so you can flash back and forth between the original 1.1.0 firmware and this variant, and the configuration will be kept intact.

Although this repo contains code for the 8xx displays, it's just leftovers from the fork. The code for these displays should compile but there are no functional changes compared to the original repo.
